    "# 🧭 **HR Analytics Dashboard**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **HR Analytics Dashboard** is a data-driven Power BI project developed to help organizations analyze and understand their workforce.\n",
    "It focuses on **employee attrition, performance, and satisfaction**, enabling HR managers to make informed decisions related to employee retention and engagement.\n",
    "\n",
    "This dashboard transforms raw HR data into meaningful insights through **interactive visualizations**, **KPIs**, and **trend analysis**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Objective of the Project**\n",
    "\n",
    "The main goals of this dashboard are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* To identify **attrition trends** (which departments or job roles have the highest employee turnover).\n",
    "* To analyze **demographics** such as age, gender, education, and marital status.\n",
    "* To evaluate **salary distribution** and **job satisfaction** across different roles.\n",
    "* To measure key performance metrics and support **strategic HR decision-making**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Data Source**\n",
    "\n",
    "* The dataset used is **HR Data.xlsx**, which includes employee information such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Age, Gender, Department, Education, Education Field\n",
    "  * Job Role, Monthly Income, Performance Rating\n",
    "  * Marital Status, Attrition (Yes/No), Job Satisfaction\n",
    "\n",
    "This data represents employee details that HR teams can use to monitor engagement and performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Tools and Technologies Used**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Power BI Desktop** – for data visualization and dashboard creation\n",
    "* **Power Query** – for cleaning and transforming the data\n",
    "* **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** – for creating calculated fields and KPIs\n",
    "* **Excel** – as the data source\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5. Data Cleaning & Transformation**\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Power Query:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Verified correct data types (e.g., numbers, text, dates).\n",
    "* Created calculated columns:\n",
    "  * `Attrition Count` \n",
    "  * `Active Employees` \n",
    "* Handled missing or inconsistent values.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **6. DAX Measures Used**\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the important measures created:\n",
    "\n",
    "```DAX\n",
    "Total Employees = COUNTROWS('HR Data')\n",
    "Attrition Count = CALCULATE(COUNTROWS('HR Data'), 'HR Data'[Attrition] = \"Yes\")\n",
    "Active Employees = [Total Employees] - [Attrition Count]\n",
    "Attrition Rate = DIVIDE([Attrition Count], [Total Employees], 0)\n",
    "Average Age = AVERAGE('HR Data'[Age])\n",
    "Avg Monthly Income = AVERAGE('HR Data'[MonthlyIncome])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "These measures are used to create **KPI Cards** showing overall statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **7. Dashboard Components**\n",
    "\n",
    "The dashboard is divided into multiple visual sections:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🧩 **KPI Cards**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Total Employees**\n",
    "* **Attrition Count**\n",
    "* **Attrition Rate**\n",
    "* **Active Employees**\n",
    "* **Average Age**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 📊 **Charts and Visuals**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Average Monthly Income by Job Role & Gender** – Line chart showing salary trends and gender gap.\n",
    "2. **Attrition Count by Department** – Clustered column chart showing which departments have high turnover.\n",
    "3. **Active Employees by Education Field** – Donut chart showing employee distribution by education background.\n",
    "4. **Performance Rating by Department** – Donut chart summarizing performance trends across departments.\n",
    "5. **Active Employees by Education Level** – Bar chart displaying educational qualifications of employees.\n",
    "6. **Active Employees by Age Band & Gender** – Stacked chart showing workforce diversity and age distribution.\n",
    "7. **Job Satisfaction by Job Role** – Matrix table showing satisfaction scores by job title.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **8. Insights Derived**\n",
    "\n",
    "* The **Sales department** shows higher attrition compared to R&D and HR.\n",
    "* **Life Sciences** and **Technical Degrees** contribute to most of the workforce.\n",
    "* Average monthly income differs across roles and genders.\n",
    "* Most employees fall in the **25–34 age group**.\n",
    "* Certain job roles show **lower job satisfaction**, which may be linked to higher attrition.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **9. Business Impact**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Helps HR identify **high-risk areas for employee turnover**.\n",
